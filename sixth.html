								<p>UC San Diego, surrounded by an endless number of suburban homes and Eucalyptus trees, is a school that seems to be in a constant state of construction and remodeling. While I was an undergrad from 2016 to 2018, there were six schools; a year and a half later, there are plans to expand to a total of nine. The school itself is a refreshing and spacious environment that is perfect for students who prefer a quiet school. Weekends with friends can be spent shopping at UTC or eating asian cuisine on the popular Convoy Street. UC Berkeley is located in a bustling city where much of the student housing is integrated into the shops and restaurants on Telegraph and Durant. Since many of the bars, shops, and restaurants are a stone throw’s away from campus, it’s fairly easy to find entertainment after an intense study session.</p>
								<p>An unforgettable and stark difference between the two schools are the restrooms. The moment I walked into the restrooms in Dwinelle Hall at UC Berkeley, I knew I was no longer in the comfort of UCSD. As a science major at UCSD, I spent most time at Galbraith Hall where the restrooms were renovated, nicely lit, and very clean. Restrooms at Berkeley seem to be very smelly, dark, and dated. Even the newer buildings such as Li Ka Shing do not have restrooms that compare to the cleanliness of the restrooms at UCSD. ERC(Eleanor Roosevelt College), provides fresh and modern housing and areas where students can study in the spaces on the first floor lounges beneath the dorms. The only remnants of the older version of UCSD can be seen at Muir. Much of Berkeley’s dorms are being renovated such as the Martinez commons, but most students find off campus housing quickly after freshman year anyway.</p>
								<p>Hands down, one aspect of UCSD I hated most was the Dining Dollar system. Even though the dining plan allows for a grab n’ go style for students who don’t want to spend an hour or more sitting for a meal, it seems to be a serious obstacle for students who require a higher intake of calories. As a 6’3 boy, there is no doubt that I need a larger calorie fill but much of my spending was cut short with the idea that I might not have enough dining dollars to last me until the end of the year. I ran out of dining dollars a quarter before the end of the year for both years at UCSD. Berkeley’s buffet style of dining was a much more affordable option for me and my tummy.</p>
								<p>The students at the two schools are extremely different in both competitive spirit and demographic. UCSD has a significant percentage of international asian students. It was very seldom that I would not hear mandarin on a daily basis. At Berkeley, there seems to be a much more diverse demographic. One trait that Berkeley kids all have in common is the competitive spirit; either to succeed or to bring others down. It is common to refer to Haas Business Majors as “snakes” for their lack of hesitation when it comes to overcoming their competitors. After the first two weeks of school, I quickly realized that the most common words among Berkeley students were: Internship, GPA, and Networking. While a majority of the students at UCSD also hold a competitive mindset, a significant portion of students are kind enough to collaborate and study with one another.</p>
								<p>Establishing the foundation of my undergrad at UCSD was definitely something that helped me form perspective after transferring. Not only was being a junior transfer an extremely humbling experience, but also I believe that my roots with UCSD enabled me to be a more sociable and well rounded individual at Berkeley. Transferring allowed me to solidify my gratitude for the quirkiness and character of both schools; whether it be as simple as a clean restroom or as complex as the student culture.</p>
